# linux\unix user management app

This is a user menu-driven application that facilitates operations on linux system users.  
It also illustrates usage of unix shell scripting, as it is developed in bash.  
It was developed on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS, but works on most linux distros.

Application options included:
* listing users & user details
* creating and deleting users
* Setting & changing passwords
* Locking & unlocking passwords

Guidlines: 

1.) press enter to display the current menu  
2.) press CTRL+d to go back to previous menu ( when asked )  
3.) make sure to run script as root  
4.) do not forget to add execution permissions on file : `chmod a+x file`
